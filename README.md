# Recurtris

This is a Tetris game, but after you clear 5 lines the drop speed gets significantly slower and a new layer of Tetris is added in! You can jump to each layer of Tetris, pause layers, and try to survive! The goal of the game is to get as many layers deep as you can, but I did try to add a scoring system in as well.

This project was made for HackCU V.

### Controls

Arrow Keys/WASD - Move the Tetris piece

Q/E - Rotate the Tetris piece

Enter - Pause the Current Layer - If you pause a layer, all subsequent layers are paused, so if you have 5 layers and pause Layer 2, you also pause layer 3, 4, and 5.

Escape - Go Back a Layer

Space - Go Forward a Layer
